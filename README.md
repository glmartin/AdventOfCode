## Go
The Go implementation uses [Go Workspaces](https://go.dev/blog/get-familiar-with-workspaces), where each day is its own module.

## Running and Testing

From the `go` directory, execute `go run` with the path to the module, and any command line params, to run. For example:
```
cd Go
go run ./2023/Day1 --part1
```

Testing is similar:
```
cd go
go test -v ./2023/Day1
```
